# Learning the Vue CLI

In this set of lessons, you will learn about the [Vue
CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) tool. This tool helps you to scaffold and prototype
new projects in Vue. In particular, the tool makes it easier to use:

- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), which provides rules for
  transitioning between different web pages in your application

- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), which provides a pattern for managing
  the data your application stores in the front end

- [Vue Single File Components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html),
  which let you put all your code -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- for a single
  component of your application into one file.

The Vue CLI also sets up [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), which will compile
your JavaScript assets into portable code (so it works with all browsers, even
if they don't support the latest ES6 features), compile single file components
into their separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, combine your JavaScript
files into a single file and compress them so your web pages load faster,
automatically reload your front end when you change it, and more.

We'll cover these in the following lessons:

- [Lesson 1](/tutorials/lesson1.html): Installing and using the Vue CLI

- [Lesson 2](/tutorials/lesson2.html): The Architecture of a Vue Application

- Lesson 3: Coming Soon
